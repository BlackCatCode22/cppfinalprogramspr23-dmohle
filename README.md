# cppFinalprogramSpr23
Demo program of points and linked lists for a final program starting point

Make your midterm program object oriented! Use points and linked list to create a program that will impress your next job interviewer!

Here are

Animals are arriving from zoos around the world and you must organize then into habitats and give them names and bithdates. You must note the age, sex, species, color, and weight of each animal and calculate a birthday from the information you receive from the originating zoo. (use  a function for this called: generateBirthDay) What will you do if the birth season is unknown? Calculate a uniqueID (using a function) and a place in your zoo using an array. Each species must have its own habitat. 

Use fileIO for reading the input file and producing the report. Use 2D arrays and 1D arrays to organize your zoo.
Use structs (if you're working on a project that requires structs), classes, linked lists, and pointers.  These programming techniques are a required part of our class and you will feel like a real programmer after understanding pointers and linked lists.

Use the text files in this repo to get your program organized. Use code from your midterm assignment to save time. 

Work through CPPfinalProgramDemo01 to get a feel for pointers and linked lists. You must devote some time to diagram and think about linked lists. Many videos are posted in the current Canvas module and view these as much as needed.



Information will arrive in the following format with an unknown number of lines.
4 year old female hyena, born in spring, tan color, 70 pounds, from Friguia Park, Tunisia
12 year old male hyena, born in fall, brown color, 150 pounds, from Friguia Park, Tunisia
4 year old male hyena, born in spring, black color, 120 pounds, from Friguia Park, Tunisia
8 year old female hyena, unknown birth season, black and tan striped color, 105 pounds, from Friguia Park, Tunisia

You will use functions to calculate the following data elements for each animal:
Unique animal ID, animal name, birth date, color, weight, origin
You must place species in their own habitat and output that in a report similar to:

Hyena Habitat:
Hy01, Smiling Girl, 4 years old, Smiling Girl, tan, 70 pounds, Friguia Park
